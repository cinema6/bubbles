<div class="c6-landing__copy">
	<p>Dave Bowman, an astronaut bound for Jupiter, suddenly finds himself locked out of the spaceship after making some important repairs outside. The only thing stopping him from reaching safety is the ship’s intelligent computer, the HAL 9000, who has some grievances with Dave he’d like to air out.</p>
	<p>It’s up to you to fill in the dialogue and choose what Chen Zhen says and how the scene plays out.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Dave &amp; HAL Need to Talk</em></strong> is a text-to-speech type of <strong><em>Screenjack</em></strong>. HAL’s original audio track has been removed, and instead we’ve replaced it with a new voice and your answers instead!</p>
