<div class="c6-landing__copy">
	<p>It&lsquo;s tough when you don&lsquo;t get along with your parents. When this kid has had enough, he decides to run away from home. Not to worry, Bumblebee is always there as the voice of reason!</p>
	<p>It&lsquo;s up to you to fill in the dialogue and choose what Bumblebee says and how the scene plays out.</p>
	<div class="annotation__img--speech">&nbsp;</div>
	<p><strong><em>The Runaway</em></strong> is a text-to-speech type of <strong><em>Screenjack</em></strong>. Bumblebee&lsquo;s original audio track has been removed, and instead we&lsquo;ve replaced it with a new voice and your answers instead!</p>
