	<p>Dave Bowman, an astronaut bound for Jupiter, suddenly finds himself locked out of the spaceship after making some important repairs outside. The only thing stopping him from reaching safety is the ship’s intelligent computer, the HAL 9000, who has some grievances with Dave he’d like to air out.</p>
