<div class="landing-section__copy--secondary">
<p>Meet Siri and control your iPhone Just by talking to her as you would to a person: "Do I need an umbrella?" or "Any great burgers around here?" or "Where's the closest ATM?" Siri not only understands what you say, it knows what you mean. Really, we promise.</p>
<p>It’s up to you to fill in the dialogue and choose what Siri says and how the scene plays out.</p>
