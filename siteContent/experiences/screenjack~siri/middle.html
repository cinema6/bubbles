<h1 class="c6-copy__section-hdr tk--hdr">The Story</h1>
<div class="c6-landing__copy">
	<p>Meet Siri and control your iPhone Just by talking to her as you would to a person: "Do I need an umbrella?" or "Any great burgers around here?" or "Where's the closest ATM?" Siri not only understands what you say, it knows what you mean. Really, we promise.</p>
	<p>It’s up to you to fill in the dialogue and choose what Siri says and how the scene plays out.</p>
	<div class="annotation__img--speech">&nbsp;</div>
	<p><strong><em>Get to Know Siri</em></strong> is a text-to-speech type of <strong><em>Screenjack</em></strong>. Siri's original audio track has been removed, and instead we’ve replaced it with a new voice and your answers instead!</p>
